        <p class="desc">
            Qeeword is a website that will help direct you straight to the official website of a brand. Qeeword will redirect you to the official website of a brand you're looking for, without providing options like other search engines. This is to protect users from entering phishing sites or fake websites.</p>
        <p class="desc">Using Qeeword is very easy. You only need to type the brand name or website name you want to search for. For example: Facebook. You just need to type "facebook" and then click search. You don't need to type the URL or link for Facebook. Using more than one word in your keyword also works, for example: login Facebook. The use of capital or lowercase letters will not affect the search results.</p>
        
        <p class="desc">The following are the objectives of creating Qeeword:</p>
        
	<li>To assist and protect genuine brand owners from unfair competition by those who use their brand name for personal gain.</li>
	<li>To protect everyone from fake websites or phishing sites.</li>
	<li>To make it easier for every Qeeword user to find the official site of a brand.</li>
	<br/>
                <p class="desc">We have already registered thousands of official brands on the Qeeword site from all over the world. However, if you have a brand and an official website that is not yet registered on Qeeword, you can register it through the following page: Submit Brand. This feature is free, and we will review your brand name and website within 2x24 hours. If its authenticity is verified, your brand keyword will be listed on the Qeeword site.</p>
